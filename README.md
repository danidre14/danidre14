### ðŸŒ± Hi, I'm Danidre, a game programmer, web developer, and software engineer!

ðŸ”­ I used to develop games in Flash, and am currently working on the [Flevar Editor](https://www.flevar.com/) for my [game engine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/flevar). My go to language is JavaScript, due to its familiarity to ActionScript 2.0.
